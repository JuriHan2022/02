          I often consider how the human experience in itself is in some ways
          quite mechanic - While may seem autonomous it is actually controlled
          by powers and desires of many institutions so engrained within our
          cultures that even those who make the structure are often unaware For
          that reason digitizing the human experience while at first sounded a
          bit uncomfortable felt like almost natural

          — In similar ways the way we emerge upon our lives while at times seem
          widely different are all similar and the way it turns out to be and
          the ways different people find their success is the new discovery of
          process that fascinates us.
